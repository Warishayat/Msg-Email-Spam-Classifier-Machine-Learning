# Email/SMS Spam Classifier

This project implements a spam classifier for email and SMS messages using machine learning techniques. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to preprocess the text and a pre-trained model to classify messages as spam or not spam.

## Installation

To set up the project, you will need to install the required libraries. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit nltk scikit-learn
```

## Project Overview

The Email/SMS Spam Classifier allows users to input a message and receive a prediction on whether it is spam or not. The model is built using text vectorization techniques and classification algorithms.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following files in your project directory:
- `vectorizer.pkl`: The trained vectorizer for text data.
- `model.pkl`: The trained classification model.

## Usage

To run the application, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.

### Input

Enter your message in the text input box and click the "predict" button.

### Output

The application will display whether the entered message is classified as spam or not spam.

## Functionality

1. **Text Preprocessing**: The input message undergoes the following steps:
   - Convert text to lowercase.
   - Tokenization (splitting the text into words).
   - Removal of special characters, punctuation, and stopwords.
   - Stemming (reducing words to their root form).

2. **Vectorization**: The preprocessed text is transformed into a numerical format suitable for the machine learning model using the pre-trained vectorizer.

3. **Prediction**: The model predicts the class of the message (spam or not spam).

4. **Display Result**: The prediction result is displayed on the user interface.

## Model Training

To train the model, you'll need a labeled dataset containing spam and non-spam messages. Follow these general steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset of SMS and email messages.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the text data using similar techniques as above.
3. **Vectorization**: Use CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer to convert text to numerical data.
4. **Model Selection**: Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM).
5. **Model Saving**: Save the trained model and vectorizer using `pickle`.

## Deployment

This application can be deployed using Streamlit Sharing, Heroku, or any cloud service that supports Python applications. Simply push your code and necessary files to the platform and follow their deployment instructions.
